ADMIN is growing, and we’re looking for a friendly, bubbly Admin Coordinator who communicates confidently, can stay organised, and enjoys helping customers.

This role suits someone with experience managing busy inboxes and calendars, handling support queries, and keeping a team running smoothly. You’ll be the central point of coordination between clients, support staff, and the CEO.

ADMIN is a customer management and automation platform designed specifically for trade and service businesses across Australia.

About the Role: 

You’ll be the first point of contact for client support, handling calls, emails, and ticket triage in the ticketing system. You’ll delegate tasks to the right team members, follow up until issues are resolved, and keep clients informed along the way. 

Once core duties are under control, you’ll also assist the CEO with admin tasks, manage the lead pipeline, and support basic marketing activities such as social media or Facebook ads scheduling.

What the Role Actually Involves:

This role includes the following duties:

    Acting as the first point of contact for support inquiries and ticket escalations

    Answering inbound calls and emails promptly and professionally

    Creating, triaging, delegating, and monitoring Zoho support tickets

    Following up with customers until issues are fully resolved

    Coordinating between technical support and onboarding teams

    Managing calendars and scheduling for the team

    Handling invoicing, accounts collections, and small account updates

    Updating customer details and processing changes in Stripe

    Assisting the CEO with administrative tasks once core duties are managed

    Managing the lead generation pipeline and supporting basic promotional activities

About You

You are friendly, bubbly, and like talking to people and resolving any issues they are running into. You have already worked in a fast-paced admin or support role and are comfortable managing multiple inboxes, calendars, and customer requests. You enjoy being busy and are eager to support a fast-growing company. 

Skills and Experience

You should be confident with customer communication across phone, email, Zoom or chat, and skilled at organising workflows and delegating tasks. 

Experience with invoicing or simple account updates is important. 

Familiarity with CRM systems or SaaS environments is helpful but not essential. 

To sum it up you are great at getting things done. Without anyone needing to manage you. 


Salary & Remote Role

This is a full-time remote role for candidates based in Australia, offering a salary between $60,000 and $75,000 depending on experience. You’ll report to the CEO.

There is potential to grow into a management role for high-performers.
